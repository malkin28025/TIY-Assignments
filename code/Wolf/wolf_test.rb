I'm sorry however I do not know the exact time. From after lunch to 
when I left around 5:15, my table mate and I putzed around with this. 
The only time I personally wasn't working on this was about 30 minutes 
when I updated my Wiki tasks and completed my WIP Issue and did my 
checkboxes and estimated my top-level tasks. Just as unproductive as 
my train trip!
